# üöÄ GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. **Create New Repository**: 
   - Click the "+" icon in top right ‚Üí "New repository"
   - Repository name: `iris-classifier-mlops` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: `Enterprise-grade MLOps pipeline for Iris flower classification with MLflow, FastAPI, and Streamlit`
   - Set to **Public** (recommended for showcase) or Private
   - ‚ùå **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you the commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/iris-classifier-mlops.git

# Rename branch to main (if not already)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Alternative Using GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)

```bash
# Create and push repository in one command
gh repo create iris-classifier-mlops --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Step 4: Verify Upload

1. **Check Repository**: Visit your new repository on GitHub
2. **Verify Files**: Ensure all 48 files are uploaded correctly
3. **Check README**: The README.md should display the complete project documentation

## üìã Repository Features to Enable

After uploading, consider enabling these GitHub features:

### 1. GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Your workflows are already in `.github/workflows/`
- They will automatically run on push/PR

### 2. Branch Protection
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches
- Add rule for `main` branch
- Require PR reviews and status checks

### 3. Repository Topics
Add these topics for discoverability:
- `mlops`
- `machine-learning`
- `mlflow`
- `fastapi`
- `streamlit`
- `docker`
- `ci-cd`
- `iris-classification`
- `python`
- `scikit-learn`

### 4. Repository Description
Use this description:
```
üå∏ Enterprise-grade MLOps pipeline for Iris flower classification featuring MLflow experiment tracking, FastAPI REST API, Streamlit web interface, Docker containerization, and automated CI/CD workflows.
```
